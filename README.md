## A simple portfolio website

In this school assignment, I was asked to create a responsive and interactive personal website using HTML and CSS only. 

Another requirements of the assignment:

1. The website has five pages including:
- index.html: homepage
- experience.html: a page with 1 table
- gallery.html: a gallery page with photos presented in structured format
- education.html: a page with 1 embedded video
- contact.html: a page with button to send me email
I also attached my CV.


2. Each of the following requirements is noted as a comment in 2 files: index.html & style.css with the corresponding label:

▪ Links to my own pages 
▪ Links to external webpages
▪ A navigation bar
▪ At least one table used in an appropriate manner
▪ At least one list (ordered or unordered)
▪ At least one local or embedded video
▪ At least five CSS3 and four HTML5 specific elements 
    NOTE:
        5 CSS3 specific elements: gradient, opacity, transition, box-shadow, @media
        4 HTML5 specific elements: footer, header, nav, section          
▪ Make use of the CSS positional properties: position, display
▪ Make use of both inline and block elements


3. Other parts of HTML and CSS going beyond what described in the lectures and practical classes that make my website responsive:
1. The use of CSS variable
2. The use of @media to set the appearance of the page for different screen-size
